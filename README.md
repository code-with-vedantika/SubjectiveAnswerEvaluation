# SubjectiveAnswerEvaluation
Developed a Streamlit-based web application that automatically evaluates students’ subjective answers by comparing them with answer keys using Semantic Similarity.


## 📌 Project Overview
The Subjective Answer Evaluation System is an AI-powered solution designed to automate the evaluation of descriptive answers in educational assessments. It helps teachers and students by analyzing answers based on **relevance, grammar, content quality, and conceptual understanding**.
